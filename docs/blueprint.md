## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL values of H30, S85%, L50% - Converted to Hex: #E65C0D This vibrant, saturated orange will give energy to the visual style and symbolize the precision focus needed for Calibration Testing. This bold color provides the proper amount of 'pop' when set against our background choice below.
- Background color: HSL values of H30, S20%, L95% - Converted to Hex: #F7F1EC. A light, desaturated orange will work for the light-color-scheme backdrop, without drawing attention away from actionable elements. We need this because orange cannot be directly paired with a gray-tone backdrop. Instead, orange should be supported by an analogous 'cousin' for this use case.
- Accent color: HSL values of H0, S75%, L60% - Converted to Hex: #D94747. Used for highlighting active UI elements and important alerts; for clear affordances, this more-saturated analogous hue is sufficiently distinct.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use crisp, modern icons with a thin stroke to maintain a clean, technical look.
- Implement a tab-based navigation with clear visual separation between Leads, Deals, and Contracts sections to improve user flow.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience, such as slide-in effects for panels and loaders, and smooth transitions on button clicks.
